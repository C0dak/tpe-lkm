Quick list of things on my TODO list:

	* protect sys_mprotect with TPE. This may get tricky, as the *file
	  isn't one of the arguments to the call, but set inline.

	* determine kernel version at compile time so we can run this on
	  RHEL5 systems w/o modifying the code

	* try to determine the address of do_execve at module init,
	  if possible (may be hard to do)

	* write Kconfig so this module can be built along with the kernel
	  source, if pushed upstream
