Quick list of things on my TODO list:

	* determine the cause of this (somewhat rare) oops:

invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP 
RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff8117b006>]  [<ffffffff8117b006>] do_execve+0x6/0x310

	* figure out why this causes problems on RHEL5 xenU kernels

	* write Kconfig so this module can be built along with the kernel
	  source, if pushed upstream

	* re-visit adding hijacks for mmap and mprotect back. I get the
	  above "invalid opcode" error far more frequently when I hijack
	  these functions too.
