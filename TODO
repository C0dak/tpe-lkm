Quick list of things on my TODO list:

	* fix the bug where some commands get killed and cause a stack
	  trace to show up in dmesg. probably a threaded issue

	* implement kernel locking

	* cover compat_do_execve and mmap as well (look at grsecurity
	  source code for more information)

	* implement options for trusted/untrusted GIDs

	* determine kernel version at compile time so we can run this on
	  RHEL5 systems w/o modifying the code

	* try to determine the address of do_execve at module init,
	  if possible (may be hard to do)

	* write Kconfig so this module can be built along with the kernel
	  source, if pushed upstream
