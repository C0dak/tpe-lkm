Quick list of things on my TODO list:

	* figure out why the GPF error is showing up on RHEL5 xenU kernels

	* try to determine the address of do_execve at module init,
	  if possible (may be hard to do)

	* write Kconfig so this module can be built along with the kernel
	  source, if pushed upstream
