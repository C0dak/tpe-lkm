Quick list of things on my TODO list:

	* Make this module build properly with dkms

	* get this working on 32bit systems. Currently, it does hijack the
	  do_execve successfully but every command returns -ENOENT. As far as I
	  can tell, the arguments to the hijacked call are messed up. The first
	  argument is gibberish, and the second argument should be the first.
	  Very strange indeed!

	* figure out why this causes problems on RHEL5 xenU kernels

	* write Kconfig so this module can be built along with the kernel
	  source, if pushed upstream
